      I am a web/hybrid software engineer who enjoys working on deadline-driven technological missions. Active users are my
      biggest motivation for continuous development. I love cross-platform/cross-device solutions and keeping up with new
      development trends. Portability of PWAs and Hybrid Apps amazes me! There are more than 35 mobile/ smartwatch apps in
      various app stores that I had the chance to contribute or develop fully. I am good with servers but better on the
      client-side. I am a rockstar in Ionic/Angular/TypeScript, proficient in NodeJS/JavaScript/Firebase and competent in
      PHP/SQL/.NET.

      I always have some side projects of my own and I used to attend hackathons a lot. I have a first-place prize from
      Macedonia, a third-place prize from Serbia, a second-place prize from Australia and some other awards and certifications
      from several countries included my home country, Turkey.
